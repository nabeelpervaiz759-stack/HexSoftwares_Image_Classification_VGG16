# HexSoftwares_Image_Classification_VGG16
Image Classification using CNN (VGG16) as part of HexSoftwares Internship

## Description
This project demonstrates image classification using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (VGG16).
The model classifies input images into different object categories based on ImageNet classes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- VGG16 (CNN)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Load pre-trained VGG16 model
2. Preprocess input images
3. Perform image classification
4. Display image with predicted labels

## Applications
- Object Recognition
- Facial Recognition (conceptual extension)
- Medical Image Analysis (conceptual extension)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the notebook:
   image_classification_vgg16.ipynb
3. Run all cells

## Output
The model displays the input image along with top-3 predicted classes.
